# A.V._Data

This GitHub serves as the central repository for all codes and notebooks related to the study on the social, economic, and cultural impact of immigration in Cataluña. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how immigration has shaped various aspects of life in the region, offering insights into demographic trends, labor market dynamics, social integration, and cultural transformation. The dataset used for this study and its results can be obtained from https://figshare.com/account/home#/projects/229650.

The Project is divided in 4 different folders.

	-carto: contains the data necesary to plot the maps.

	-Economic_Sector: holds the notebooks used to study the correlation between nationality and the economic sector in which a given person is working.
	The code is divided into three notebooks:
		·Poblacion_edad_trabajar.ipynb: Filters the dataset 'Poblacion_inmigrante.csv' to extract information about the number of migrants (by country of birth and municipality) who are of working age.
		·Correlacion_Sector-Nacionalidad.ipynb: computes the Pearson coefficent correlation between the number of migrants of each nationality nd the number of Jobs in the four main economic activities in the región (primary sector, industry sector, construction sector and service sector).
		·World_map_plot_of_correlations.ipynb: plots a world heat map to show the Pearson coefficent value for each nationality and a given sector.
